Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground.
After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the 350 mile-wide 560 kilometer-wide storm had moved slightly to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast.
Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help was growing.
