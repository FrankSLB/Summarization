British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973.
The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff, Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview Sunday.
She regarded it as a private meeting, said Mark Worthington, spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister from 1979 90.
